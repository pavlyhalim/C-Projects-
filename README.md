Water-Pressure-Exerted-on-a-Dam

Using the polynomials that represent the Water exerts pressure on the upstream face of a dam,
print a table using units of meter of water elevation and Newton of force. Asking the user to
input the values for the channel base width, channel depth, water elevation above channel
bottom, distance between edge to the bank of channel. Also find the force of pressure and
calculate force for a range of water elevations.
